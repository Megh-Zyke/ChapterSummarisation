{"information": "**Title:** The Dynamics of Industrialization in Britain\n\n**Subtopics:**\n\n**1. The Leading Sectors of Industrialization**\n- Cotton: dominant in the first phase (up to 1840)\n- Iron and steel: led the way after 1840 with railway expansion\n- Demand for iron and steel increased rapidly in colonies from 1860\n- By 1873, Britain exported iron and steel worth \u00a377 million (double its cotton exports)\n\n**2. The Persistence of Traditional Industries**\n- New industries did not easily displace traditional ones\n- Less than 20% of the workforce employed in advanced industrial sectors by the end of the 19th century\n- Textiles remained a dynamic sector, but much production occurred outside factories\n\n**3. Innovation in Traditional Industries**\n- Small innovations contributed to growth in non-mechanical sectors\n- Examples include food processing, building, pottery, glasswork, tanning, furniture making, and implement production\n- Technological changes occurred slowly and did not spread widely\n\n**4. Barriers to Technological Adoption**\n- New technology was expensive\n- Merchants and industrialists were cautious about using machines\n- Machines often broke down and repairs were costly\n- Inventions and manufacturing claims were often exaggerated\n\n**Important Dates and Formulae:**\n\n* 1840: Cotton industry's dominance ends\n* 1847: Railway expansion begins in England\n* 1860: Railway expansion begins in colonies\n* 1873: Britain exports \u00a377 million worth of iron and steel"}
