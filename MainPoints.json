{"information": "**Title:** The Age of Industrialisation\n\n**Subtopics:**\n\n**1. Before the Industrial Revolution**\n- Proto-industrialisation: Large-scale industrial production for an international market before the establishment of factories.\n- Merchants moved to the countryside, supplying money to peasants and artisans to produce goods for international trade.\n- Urban craft guilds restricted production and competition, limiting merchants' ability to expand within towns.\n\n**1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory**\n- Earliest factories in England emerged in the 1730s, but multiplied in late 18th century.\n- Cotton industry boomed, with imports of raw cotton soaring from 2.5 million pounds in 1760 to 22 million pounds in 1787.\n- Inventions increased productivity and enabled production of stronger threads and yarn.\n- Richard Arkwright's cotton mill brought all production processes under one roof, allowing for supervision, quality control, and labor regulation.\n\n**1.2 The Pace of Industrial Change**\n- Cotton and metals were the most dynamic industries in Britain.\n- Cotton led the first phase of industrialisation up to the 1840s, followed by iron and steel.\n\n**Dates and Formulae:**\n\n| Date | Formula | Significance |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1730s | N/A | Earliest factories in England |\n| 1760 | N/A | Britain importing 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton |\n| 1787 | N/A | Britain importing 22 million pounds of raw cotton |\n| Late 18th century | N/A | Multiplication of factories |\n| 1840s | N/A | Iron and steel industry becomes the leading sector |\n**Title:** The Age of Industrialisation\n\n**Subtopics:**\n\n**1.
